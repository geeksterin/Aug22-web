          <p id="coin_description">
            Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer
            technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the
            transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency. It was created
            by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto.
            The source code is available publicly as an open source project,
            anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.
            Bitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The idea was
            to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central
            authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure,
            verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer
            internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction
            fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time
            with no central authority and banks. Bitcoin is designed to have
            only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary
            currency. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average
            transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining
            Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the
            hash rate has shot up to peta hashes. Being the first successful
            online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative
            currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on. The
            cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the
            turing-complete smart contract by Ethereum which led to the
            development of other amazing projects such as EOS, Tron, and even
            crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties.
